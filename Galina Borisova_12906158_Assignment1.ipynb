    "Within the current US presidential campaign the public relations and marketing firm was employed by the US democratic party to help developing a communication strategy for the democrats political campaign. Given that nowadays online communication is a very important public sphere one of the goals of this company is to trace what kind of tweets draw more attention of online audience/potential voters and therefore get more retweets than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "   Some scholars contend that the modern politics is now deeply intertwined with popular culture that causes the intervention of emotionality in the political sphere. In other words, it means that people seek certain kinds of emotionalized experience from politics that they used to obtain from the popular culture only (Richards, 2004). In this light, sentiments are the important factor that should be analyzed and taken into consideration while developing and running the election campaign. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the company established emotionality as an important criterion for analyzing the tweets about the democrats. Political advertising is one of the areas where people's emotions and its role in communication is being scrutinized in the academic circles as well as among PR practitioners especially prior the US presidential election, therefore, the following research question is of high academic and societal relevance:\n",

    "With regards to the audience reaction to the tone of the information there is an increasing array of articles in political science and psychology that suggests that the effect of increase in negativity of the message has greater influence over the recipient’s perception than the increase in positivity of the same amplitude. In psychology literature on impression formation researchers revealed that unfavorable information has a greater impact on impressions than does favorable information in very different life situations (Singh and Teoh 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tenet of psychologists was supported by the scholars that examined the role of the news sentiments over readers’ perception (Soroka, 2006; Damstra & Boukes, 2018) especially while reading economic journalistic features (Tetlock, 2007). Such asymmetric responsiveness could be explained by the fact that people care more strongly about a potential loss (including financial loss) than they do about a gain of the same value (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile asymmetry in responses to negative versus positive information was also revealed in the political domain by the researchers. There is evidence that negative information plays a greater role in voting behaviour and, more specifically, that U.S. presidents were tremendously punished by the electorate for negative economic trends but gained lesser electoral benefits from positive trends (Nannestad and Paldam, 1997). 'Asymmetries have also been identified in the formation of more general impressions of U.S. presidential candidates and parties and negativity was found to have a greater effect on voters impression than positivity' according to Niven (2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, the tendency of assymetric response to negative and positive information were found not in psychological scholarship, but also in the literature on politics. Deploying academic findings mentioned above for our examining case, the company hypothesizes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "H1: Negative tweets about the democrats get more retweets than positive tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the literature the following key concept is going to be used in this work:\n",

    "Influence of tweets sentiment over Twitter users’ behavior ‒ the effect of tone of the tweets over the decision of the readers to retweet such information. \n"

However, we would like to make more demonstrative visualization showing simultaneously relations between overall negative, overall positive and the number of retweets they got. For this purpose, using information from Stack Overflow, lets create a new column, that would contain information about positivity (1) and negativity (0) of tweets excluding neutral tweets. We will use this data set only to show the visualization. Later in our analysis we will stick to the 'merged' file."

    "Overall, the conducted analyses showed no statistically significant relations between the positivity or negativity of the tone of the tweets about democrats and the number of the retweets they gained. Therefore, the hypothesis of the current analysis, namely that the negative tweets get more retweets than positive tweets about democrats, was not supported. \n",
    "However, based on the results of the visualization of relations between positive/negative tweets and the number of retweets they received we could make some preliminary assumptions regarding the inspected data set (see the visualization above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we could contemplate, that there could be a certain trend in the relations between emotionality of the tweets and the number of time they got retweeted, namely the positive tweets gained more retweets than negative (roughly around 0.25 against 0.022 respectively). However, the visualization also shows that the confidence intervals of two groups overlap, that makes the results insignificant. We could assume that the greater sample size of the tweets (see the Limitations and Other Steps section) could change the confident intervals and lead to statistical significance of the results, but based on the scrutinized data we could not be sure that that will come true and, therefore, we leave it as an assumption only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similar tendency in data was showed by predictive analytics using machine learning. According to the predictions, positive tweet would have on average 0.074 retweets against 0.068 for negative. Meanwhile neutral tweet has the lowest among other categories predicted amount of retweets — 0.059 However, it could be true only for the given data set since the linear regression model shows no statistical significance or no correlation between the tone of the tweet and the retweets. P values for both categories were greater than 0.05 and R-squared appeared to be 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Same results were showed after running the second model — those observations mean that the tried models are poorly fitting and the variables we used have no statistically significant correlation with the number of retweets. Nevertheless, we created another model with a control variable 'from_user_friendcount' the results were significant (P-value = 0.000, although with a very low R-squared - 0.003), but it  showed a very little effect of this variable."

    "Relatively small sample size of retweets could be considered as one of the limitations of this work. For approximately 17,000 tweets we have relatively low retweet rate ‒ overall about 740 tweets. We can only assumed that one of the reasons of it could be that a lot of tweets were generated by so called ‘Twitter’ bots – the software that could autonomously acts as an ordinary users and being able to tweet, retweet, follow, unfollowing, and even  message other users. We initially thought that this kind of Twitter ids would have smaller number of friends and therefore lesser (or 0) number of retweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to address this issue by using the 'from_user_friendcount' variable. We assumed that those users with the greater friend lists could have a greater effect over others, but we should admit, that it is not necessarily true. One should emphasize that Twitter bots acting as users could potentially also have a large online ‘bots’ friends circle since they can follow each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation we had was the fact that some of the initial tweets was reposted from the media channels, such as CNN, that change the nature of the tweet and possible could be eliminated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the next step in trying to find what influences users to retweets the particular tweets we would try to identify if the tweet was tweeted by the real person of by the bots, although it is a tremendously complicated task to fulfill. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, for the further analysis other variables could be examined to find what factor influences the number of times the tweet got retweeted. Namely, it could be, for example, the location (in one state democrats are more popular than others) or number of likes of dislikes (that makes the messages more popular) of the initial tweets received. To support such hypotheses the relevant academic literature should be reviewed.\n"

   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "While working with the data there are some ethical considerations that the organization should have. One of the most important ethical issues while working with the social media data is the privacy intervention as well as the ownership of the digital data, according to Neil Lawrence (2015). Even though the concept of privacy is notoriously difficult to define and fix (Finn and Wadhwa, 2014) it could be the real issue in our case. The data that we use for the analysis could enable to identify the real users given that we have a location information in our data set and a lot of users on Twitter use real names and pictures, that all bear a treat to the anonymity of people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, such data is being used without the consent of the Tweeter users to whom that data relates, that arises the issue of transparency, where users are explicitly notified about the usage of their data. Such privacy intervention could provoke outrage from those who have been (or might have been) the targets of the intervention without prior consent (Shah et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the users of the data analysis they should be aware of the issue of voters manipulation should be considered. Based on the sentiment analysis results individuals could become the objects of personalized advertising (Finn and Wadhwa, 2014). If following the given recommendation any correlation between sentiment and other variables from the data set could be established it could be used even to manipulate the individuals’ sentiments without their understanding (Finn and Wadhwa, 2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "Profiling and segmentation are another serious issue with regards to the big data collection and usage, that is widely discussed in academia and professional circles. Profiling, according to Wigan and Clarke (2013), implies inferring from existing data holdings a set of characteristics for a particular category of person, with the intention of singling out other individuals who closely fit that set of characteristics. That could lead to exercise of preexisting biases for,\n",
    "and particularly against, racial, ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic stereotypes (Wigan and Clarke, 2013).\n",
    "Moreover, segmentation leads to bigger social inequality when, specifically in our example, political debate can become limited as campaigns direct their strategies to particular voters, while ignoring less powerful and influencing part of the electorate (Kreiss and Howard, 2010). Segmentation also jeopardizes the diversity of the people’s choice since the users are being exposed to a certain information according to their ‘customer group’ assigned based on digital data analysis. That makes their choice restricted and even nor fully informed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More broader, segmentation of the audience could threaten the participatory democracy by excluding the niche group (as outliers or those who are far from the mean in the analyzed data set) from the public sphere, that should be also taken in consideration by the users of the digital data analysis results. Thus, as stated by Harper (2017), the generalized result of digital data analysis would lead to hegemony of majority and lack of pluralism.\n"
